# Uber Fixture — Progress

## 2026-04-13: Transport upgrade — Tier 1 (DOM clicks) → Tier 5 (page.evaluate API)

**Context:** After fixing removeFromCart with DOM-based checkout edit modal approach, CDP network interception revealed the actual mutation APIs: `createDraftOrderV2` (add) and `discardDraftOrdersV1` (remove). Both work via `page.evaluate(fetch)`.

**Changes:**
- Rewrote both `addToCart` and `removeFromCart` to pure API calls — zero DOM selectors
- `addToCart`: validates store/item via `getStoreV1`, calls `createDraftOrderV2` with item details + customizations
- `removeFromCart`: finds item via `getDraftOrdersByEaterUuidV1`, calls `discardDraftOrdersV1`
- Added `customizations` parameter to addToCart for items with required options (sauces, sides)
- Customization format: `{groupUuid: [{uuid: optionUuid, quantity: 1}]}` — get groups/options from `getMenuItemV1`

**Discovery path:** Earlier probing (35+ endpoints) missed these APIs because:
1. `createDraftOrderV2` was probed as V1 (V1 returns 404, V2 exists)
2. `discardDraftOrdersV1` was never guessed (probed removeFromCartV1, deleteCartItemV1, etc.)
3. CDP-level network interception of the actual DOM button clicks revealed the real endpoint names

**Verification:** 5/5 ops pass (`pnpm dev verify uber --browser --write`). Stable across multiple runs.

## 2026-04-13: Fix removeFromCart — server-side draft orders + checkout edit modal

**Context:** removeFromCart was failing with selector timeout. The previous implementation tried guessed selectors (`cart-item-delete-button`, `delete-button`, etc.) on the checkout page, none of which exist.

**Key discovery:** UberEats cart IS server-side via draft orders. `getDraftOrdersByEaterUuidV1` returns cart items with `shoppingCartItemUuid` and `draftOrderUUID` after DOM add-to-cart. This corrects the earlier probe finding that "no server-side cart API exists" — the draft order read APIs were returning empty because no items had been added during probing.

**Changes:**
- Rewrote `removeFromCart` adapter: calls `getDraftOrdersByEaterUuidV1` to find item, navigates directly to `/checkout?mod=editItem&modctx=...` using draft order IDs, clicks "Remove from cart" button with retry loop
- Switched test fixture to DASANI Bottled Water (`66c6b385-0b1f-5a75-ada7-649e8b309fff`) — simple item with no required customizations. The previous McNuggets item now requires sauce selection, causing addToCart to silently fail.
- Updated DOC.md: corrected cart architecture (server-side via draft orders, not in-memory only)

**Transport investigation:** All 10 probed cart mutation endpoints (addToCartV1, removeFromCartV1, etc.) return 404 "Missing RPC handler". No transport upgrade possible for cart mutations — DOM interaction remains the only path (Tier 1). However, removeFromCart now uses server-side draft order API for item discovery (Tier 5 hybrid).

**Verification:** 5/5 ops pass (`pnpm dev verify uber --browser --write`). Stable across 2 consecutive runs.

## 2026-04-09: Added getRestaurantMenu + addToCart adapter

**What changed:**
- Added `getRestaurantMenu` operation via `getStoreV1` API — returns full menu with categories, items, prices, images, availability
- Added `addToCart` adapter operation — navigates to item quickView modal, clicks "Add to order" (page transport)
- Created adapter `uber-eats.ts` for browser-based cart interaction
- Updated DOC.md with menu browsing and add-to-cart workflows
- Total operations: 4 (searchRestaurants, getRestaurantMenu, addToCart, getEatsOrderHistory)

**Why:**
- Core food delivery flow was broken — users could search restaurants but couldn't see menus
- Now supports: search → browse menu → add to cart → review past orders

**Key discoveries during probe:**
- Menu data comes from `getStoreV1` API — `catalogSectionsMap` keyed by section UUID, each containing `standardItemsPayload.catalogItems` with item UUIDs, titles, prices (cents), images
- No server-side add-to-cart API exists — cart is managed client-side in localStorage (`ubereats.v2.cart`)
- DataDome bot detection scripts are present but `_p/api` endpoints work reliably from node transport
- Store UUID in URLs is base64url-encoded UUID bytes; API requires full UUID format (e.g. `8b2f2683-50d3-4e3f-8c2e-3d00686aa3e7`)
- `getMenuItemV1` API fires when clicking a menu item — takes storeUuid, sectionUuid, subsectionUuid, menuItemUuid

**Verification:** 3/3 read ops pass (`pnpm --silent dev verify uber`). addToCart is write-op (skipped by default).

## 2026-04-13 — Fix: addToCart optimization — remove redundant API call and waits

**Context:** addToCart was timing out due to a redundant `getMenuItemV1` API validation call and overly conservative wait times. The item is already validated by catalog lookup in step 2.
**Changes:** Removed `getMenuItemV1` call (catalog lookup already confirms item existence). Reduced `ensureUberEatsPage` timeout from 30s to 15s and wait from 3s to 1.5s. Removed post-navigation 4s wait (replaced by `waitFor` on add button). Reduced post-click wait from 3s to 1.5s.
**Verification:** `pnpm build` passes. addToCart completes within timeout budget.

## 2026-03-23: Initial discovery — Eats search, ride history, Eats orders

**What changed:**
- Discovered Uber's dual API architecture: Eats REST (`_p/api/*`) + Rides GraphQL (`riders.uber.com/graphql`)
- Built L3 adapter (`uber-api.ts`) handling both API surfaces via `page.evaluate(fetch(...))`
- Created 3 operations: `searchRestaurants`, `getRideHistory`, `getEatsOrderHistory`
- Captured API traffic via scripted Playwright CDP recording (multiple passes: initial capture, rides-focused, fare-estimate attempts)
- Added "Multi-Domain Platform" archetype to `knowledge/archetypes.md`

**Why:**
- Target intents: get ride price estimate, get ride history, search restaurants (Eats)
- Achieved 2 of 3 targets; ride price estimate blocked by non-standard React UI components on m.uber.com

**Key discoveries during capture:**
- `m.uber.com/go/graphql` and `riders.uber.com/graphql` share the same GraphQL schema but serve different page contexts
- Eats REST uses `_p/api/<operationName>` convention with POST + JSON body; CSRF is static `x-csrf-token: x`
- Ride history not on `m.uber.com/go/activity` (redirects to home); must use `riders.uber.com/trips` which calls `Activities` GraphQL query
- Eats order history uses map pattern (`ordersMap` keyed by `orderUuids` array) rather than flat array
- Fare estimation requires deep UI interaction — m.uber.com inputs have zero standard HTML attributes (no data-testid, no placeholder, no aria-label)

**Verification:** All 3 operations verified via manual Playwright script — searchRestaurants returned 71 results for "pizza", getRideHistory returned 5 past rides with fares, getEatsOrderHistory returned 10 orders with items and prices.
